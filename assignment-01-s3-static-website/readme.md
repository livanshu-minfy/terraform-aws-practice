# assignment-01-s3-static-website

I have created a remote backend in backend.tf in which I have added  key = "assignment-1/terraform.tfstate" due to which .tfstate file goes to an s3 bucket created earlier named "livanshu-terraform-state-1210"

I ran the code and it ran successfully and the .tfstate went to remote backend and the static website can be seen in the differnet s3 bucket named "minfy-training-livanshu-s3-3451"
